##A small app to demonstrate the relation between the mighty code and the lame parameter.

To demonstrate the relation between code as software and parameters this little program for Cairo pentagonal tiling was written.
Cairo tiles are quite interesting. They have four equal sides, two rectangular and two other equal angles. The last one is the key angle. It, and only it determines the shape.
This software exposes the key-angle of the Cairo tiles as sole parameter. The key angle as input parameter is the only one that can be changed. It can be modified from 45 to 135 degrees.
The Program is very restricted and very limited to the user. If you want more, you have to change the code for yourself.
